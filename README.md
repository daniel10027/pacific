# Agricultural Projects

This is the final project for the course [Introduction to mobile device programming](http://imoviles.alumnos.exa.unicen.edu.ar/).

## Objective

Write an application that allows providers of agricultural services to inform their customers about projects made.
The application should allow them take photos, set a name, a description and a location of the project made, and this information should be stored in a database.
Then, the user can see the information of the database in a "List of jobs", and selecting a particular job should show it.
Any project can be exported and shared. The receiver, should be able to open the project, and optionally, add it to its own database.
On the other hand, the user might choose to see a Google Map with all the jobs in its own database.
 
## Disclaimer

- I made this project with the intention of learning Ionic 2, and getting a better understanding of Angular 2 and TypeScript. So there may be some misconceptions, if you find something that you don't like, please open an issue or send a PR :)
- This project was made with Ionic 2 and Angular 2 still on Beta, and it was only tested on Android 6.
